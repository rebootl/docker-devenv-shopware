This is used to create a local development environment for an existing shopware installation.

Usage:

- shopware installation should go to `./shopware`
- database to `./db/shopware6.sql`
- adapt ports etc. to your liking

Shop front: http://localhost:2020/public/

Admin: https://localhost:2020/public/admin/

Note: The sales channel URL has to be adapted in the Admin.

Note2: I know there is a Dockware solution for docker but I wasn't sure how to use this for an existing installation...
